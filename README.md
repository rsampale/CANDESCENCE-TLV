# CANDESCENCE-TLV

This is the reworked and rebuilt version of the initial TLV model which was built in R and Tensorflow/Keras. This version uses Python and PyTorch.

This project analyzes C. albicans colony images in bulk, and outputs latent space data (from our CVAE), which is then further analyzed for morphological patterns and correlations. Model preformance metrics are also generated.
For a more in-depth look at each file and function, and how to run the model - please see the PDF "TLV Repo Structure".

Data used for testing and evaluation of the model came from the Berman Lab at the University of Tel-Aviv. Any other candida images in the same size format should also work.
